    "# Designing a Suite of Creative Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project, really, is to design a suite of creative tools that can be used to inform content development around a particular talent roster. The use cases are fairly self-explanatory, but in short there is a huge investment of human capital in ideating, developing and honing pitches for content that by and large never gets made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we could shift the most time-intensive tasks to applied AI applications to help reduce the cost of a development pipeline. This is poarticularly true for media outlets focused on distribution, conversion and monetization of formatted content, rather than on innovating new media and new delivery platforms. In other words, when it's been done before and all you're looking for is the next iteration of the content built around the next generation of talent, there's no need to pour human resources into the development phase. The question is really, what do audiences want to see this season and how can we align our creator assets to revenue sources—mainly advertising and brand partnerships.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we will build out tools that can help streamline the content development process so that precious sales time is not wasted by prolonged RFP response times and talent sourcing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
